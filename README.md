# tox-asdf

A Tox plugin using [asdf] to find python executables.


## Prerequisites

This plugin is made exclusevly to support [asdf] so obviously you will need a functionnal [asdf] installation as well as the [`asdf-python`][asdf-python] plugin.


## Installation

Simply install `tox-asdf` in addition to `tox` to get ready:

```shell
pip install tox tox-asdf
```

That's it, you can now run `tox` as usual but using [asdf] Python installations.

## Options

### No fallback on system pythons

By default this plugin won't fail if a required Python version is missing from `Ã¦sdf`, tox will fallback on its classic way of finding Python binaries from `$PATH`.
You can override this behavior and force `tox` to only use `asdf` by using the `--asdf-no-fallback` option:

```shell
tox --asdf-no-fallback
```

### Automatically install pythons

By default, `tox-asdf` won't try to install missing Python version, but you can force this by using the `--asdf-install` option.

```shell
tox --asdf-install
```

Obviously this will only useful on the first run.
